	<h1>When Squids Attack!</h1>
	<h3>Description & Project Role</h3>
	<p>
		<em>When Squids Attack!</em> is a simulation with the intention of representing an automated environment
		where creatures interact with each other realistically. It was an independent project; I created all code and assets.
	</p>
	<br />
	
	<h3>Technical Overview & My Contribution</h3>
	<p>
		The simulation was created in Unity 4.3, and was programmed in C#. The squid and fish behaviors are controlled through
		the implementation of various steering behaviors - algorithms based on vector math to determine action. The squid and fish
		constantly detect each other, and decide how to move based on their distance from each other. The squid seeks the
		nearest fish, eats it once it catches it, and targets the next closest fish after a moment of rest. The fish move in flocks,
		which can dynamically break and merge back together, and which tend to move between the glowing plants. They avoid
		the squid once it gets too close. All of the creatures avoid the various obstacles, such as coral.
	</p>
	<br />
	
	<h3>Mechanics & Design</h3>
	<p>
		There is no player interaction - the project is entirely a simulation. The camera follows the squid, who undoubtedly eventually
		catches all of the fish. The objects on the map are randomly placed with each run of the simulation, adding a little extra diversity
		to each viewing.
