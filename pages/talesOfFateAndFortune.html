	<h1>Tales of Fate and Fortune</h1>
	<h3>Summary</h3>
	<p>
		<em>Tales of Fate and Fortune</em> is a tabletop game that was developed in five weeks. 
		The gameplay is DnD-inspired cooperative PvE. Players act as bouny hunters; each 'bounty' (boss) requires facing a 
		certain number of 'fates' (event cards) before reaching it. Successfully handling fates can lead to the acquisition of 'fortunes' 
		(valuable items). The game is styled after Ancient Greece, Rome, Persia, and Egypt. The fortunes, fates, 
		races, and bounties are all drawn from these cultures.

	<h3>My Contribution</h3>
	<p>
		My primary role was developing the enemies. Through this project and others like it, I've come to find how much I enjoy 
		integrating theme into mechanics, especially when working within limitations such as those presented by tabletop games. 
		The bounties were a great opportunity to do this; Stheno (pictured first) contains my favorite mechanic in her form change, 
		which uses something that players need to keep track of anyways (e.g. health) as a variable. Additionally, since enemy health 
		is something you can vaguely control, you can effectively keep her in your preferred form if you strategize well. This amazingly 
		creates a form of <a href="http://gaming.wikia.com/wiki/Kiting">kiting</a> in a game without a board or any sort of concept 
		of physical space.
	</p>
	<br />
	
	<h3>Moving Forward</h3>
	<p>
		I'm fairly proud of my work here, and I think the integration of flavor with the combat mechanics means the game could be
		successful moving forward. The problem with this project is the sheer amount of content it needs. For it to feel anything like
		DnD, it would require an atrocious amount of events to make the gameplay varied (or a more clever way to "procedurally
		generate" board game content).
	</p>
	<br />
	<p>
		That being the case, while I believe the game could be successful, the more viable option
		would likely be moving away from the DnD theme, maybe even making it a board game while keeping the randomization
		brought about by randomly chosen bounties and events.
