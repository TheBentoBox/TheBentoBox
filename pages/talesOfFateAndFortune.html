	<h1>Tales of Fate and Fortune</h1>
	<h3>Description & Project Role</h3>
	<p>
		<em>Tales of Fate and Fortune</em> is a board game that was developed in five weeks. I aided in the design
		of the playable races and their themes, and was the lead 'bounty' (enemy and boss) designer.
	</p>
	<br />
	
	<h3>Mechanics & Design</h3>
	<p>
		The gameplay is cooperative PvE, inspired by <em>DnD</em>. Players act as bouny hunters, who are tasked
		with bringing down a powerful bounty. Each bounty requires players to face a certain amount of 'fates' (event cards)
		before reaching it. Successfully handling fates can lead to the acquisition of 'fortunes' (valuable items). There are
		four playable races, each inspired by a different Earthen culture (Ancient Greece, Rome, Persia, and Egypt). The
		fortunes, the events of the fates, and the bounty enemies all draw from these themes as well.
	</p>
	<br />
	
	<h3>My Contribution</h3>
	<p>
		The game was developed in a group of four students (including myself). My primary role was developing the bounties,
		who are represented by enemies drawing from various ancient cultures. Through this project and others like it, I've 
		come to find how much I enjoy integrating theme into mechanics, especially when working within limitations such as
		those presented by tabletop games.
	</p>
	<br />
	<p>
		I came to find that this the most difficult part of enemy design (at least for tabletop games); making the theme come
		through can be difficult without muddying the mechanics. You don't have tools like variables so readily available to you
		as you do when programming, and the tabletop equivalents (counters, dials, die) force players to remember more than
		is probably necessary with a cleaner design. 
	</p>
	<br />
	<p>
		Stheno (pictured first in the image gallery) contains my favorite single mechanic in the game (her form change). It's a 
		really nice way to merge mechanics, by using something that players need to keep track of anyways (her health). Additionally, 
		since enemy health is something you can vaguely control, you can effectively keep her in your preferred form if you strategize 
		well. This amazingly creates a form of <a href="http://gaming.wikia.com/wiki/Kiting">kiting</a> in a game without a board 
		or any sort of concept of physical space.
