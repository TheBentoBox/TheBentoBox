	<h1>Leap of Faith</h1>
	<h3>Summray & Technical Overview</h3>
	<p>
		<em>Leap of Faith</em> is a 2D sidescroller runner that was created in five weeks. The game is styled as taking place in an Egyptian temple. This is partially reflected in the characters, whose style is inspired by a mix of ancient Egypt and Greece. The player controls a party of three characters which they can freely switch between, and the current partly leader can cast their abilities with the Q, W, and E keys. Each character has a different set of abilities.
	</p>
	<br />
	<p>
		The game was created in JavaScript using canvas. It uses the same lighting engine as in <em>Lumina</em> (also featured on this portfolio), and it uses no pre-defined JavaScript game engine library (the game code is all mine).
	</p>
	<br />

	<h3>Technical Overview & My Contribution</h3>
	<p>
		I acted as the lead gameplay programmer and engine developer. My work on the engine included the code for game objects (movement, jumping, and platforming physics), input recognition and routing, lighting, and most other gameplay elements such as entity health and ability cooldowns. I also animated the characters once given the file for each character split into their various body parts.
	</p>
	<br />

	<h3>Post-Mortem</h3>
	<p>
		The core concept of this game could definitely be taken much further: varied environments to make it less stale, difficulty settings (perhaps a hard mode where abilities don't auto-aim), and multiple simultaneous enemies. The enemies and levels also have potential for more diversity, such as levels where the direction changes over time, and end-of-level bosses.
	</p>
	<br />
	<p>
		That being said, while the game turned out well given the short development timespan, it doesn't have quite as unique of a hook as some of the other projects I've worked on and featured here (it's essentially a runner version of <em>Trine</em>), so it wouldn't be a high priority as a project I'd want to return to.
