	<h3>Description & Project Role</h3>
	<p>
		<em>Traction</em> is a simple technical prototype of a 2D open world sandbox game, created as an honors project. 
		I was the lead gameplay programmer.
	</p>
	<br />

	<h3>Technical Overview & My Contribution</h3>
	<p>
		<em>Traction</em> was created in <a target="_blank" href="https://processing.org/">Processing</a>. This added an enjoyable complexity to the
		project, as Processing is only made to run visual simulations or simple arcade games. The terrain generation algorithm uses Perlin noise, and tree and cave
		system generation uses L-systems to create dnyamic branching patterns. It stores the world in a three dimensional array which is queried for all block
		checks, including for collisions, meaning no actual objects representing the blocks are ever created. It uses textures from <em>Minecraft</em>, as
		the project is a technical display that isn't meant for release.
	</p>
	<br />

	<h3>Mechanics & Design</h3>
	<p>
		The actual gameplay is very limited, as it was more of a prototype project than anything else. It plays more like a physics
		or world gen toy rather than as a full game.
	</p>
	<br />
	<p>
		The player has two tools which can be switched between by pressing 'T': the mining drill and the gravity gun. The mining
		drill breaks blocks, which can be placed again later. The gravity gun provides the core physics mechanic, allowing you to grab
		blocks, which then gravitate towards the mouse as a floating physics object. They react with the terrain in real time as
		you drag them around, and can freely be dropped or thrown about.
