	<h1>Traction</h1>
	<h3>Summary & Technical Overview</h3>
	<p>
		<em>Traction</em> is a simple technical prototype of a 2D open world sandbox game, created as an honors project in <a target="_blank" href="https://processing.org/">Processing</a>. This added an enjoyable complexity to the project, as Processing is only made to run visual simulations or simple arcade games. The terrain generation algorithm uses Perlin noise, and tree and cave system generation uses L-systems to create dnyamic branching patterns. It stores the world in a three dimensional array which is queried for all block checks, including for collisions, meaning no actual objects representing the blocks are ever created. It borrows textures from <em>Minecraft</em>, as the project is a technical display that isn't meant for release.

	<h3>My Contribution</h3>
	<p>
		My role was as a gameplay programmer and lead framework programmer, which spanned the world generation, biome code, player movement, and world rendering. It took a while to even get the game working, which was largely due to it being massively overscoped for something meant to be handled by Processing, which is generally used for more simple graphical simulations and sketch tools, let alone it being new development territory for us.

	<h3>Post-Mortem</h3>
	<p>
		The actual gameplay is very limited, as it was more of a prototype project than anything else. It plays more like a physics or world gen toy than anything else. While the idea of making a more involved 2D or 3D procedural sandbox-survival game is fun, I don't think I would do it again as anything more than a learning experience. Particularly since <em>Minecraft</em>'s release, that market has become very saturated (Minecraft, Terraria, Starbound, Cube World, Don't Starve, and Rust, to name a few).
