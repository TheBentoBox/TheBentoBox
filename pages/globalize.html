	<h1>Globalize</h1>
	<h3>Description & Project Role</h3>
	<p>
		<em>Globalize</em> is a simulation created as a cultural anthropology research project. It attempts
		to emulate the basic features of city building games, while displaying in real time how your city's culture
		is affected by the changes you make.
	</p>
	<br />
	
	<h3>Technical Overview & My Contribution</h3>
	<p>
		<em>Globalize</em> was developed in Game Maker Studio, written in GML.
		The underlying system is based on a relationship between <em>societal aspects</em> and
		<em>cultural values</em>, which are tied together via a complex weighting system. Societal
		aspects are defined as the building blocks of a culture (clothes, music, food, education,
		technology), while cultural values are less materialistic qualities that define interculture
		and intraculture relationships.

	<h3>Mechanics</h3>
	<p>
		The map is randomly generated with each run. Players can freely claim hex plots of land, which will
		have a variety of materials within them. What materials are obtained and what buildings are placed will
		internally affect societal aspects, which then in turn updates the culture's values, which are displayed
		in the sidebar. Players can freely expand and place buildings to see how the simulated values are affected.
	</p>
	<br />
	
	<h3>Reflection</h3>
	<p>
		Working on this project ended up being very poignant. When playtesting, I found that industrial buildings
		were the quickest way to ensure cultural expansion, even though they had numerous negative side effects
		as well. Just by plugging in the numbers, the simulation demonstrated that industrialization is the fast path
		to globalization - it is hard to expand as a culture and still preserve what makes your culture unique.
