	<h1>Globalize</h1>
	<h3>Summary & Technical Overview</h3>
	<p>
		<em>Globalize</em> is a simulation created as a study of cultural anthropology. It attempts to emulate the basic features of city building games, while displaying in real time how your city's culture is affected by the changes you make. 
		It was developed in Game Maker Studio, and written in GML. The underlying system is based on a relationship between <em>societal aspects</em> and <em>cultural values</em>, which are tied together via a complex weighting system. Societal aspects represent the building blocks of a culture (clothes, food, education), while cultural values are less materialistic qualities that define interculture and intraculture relationships.

	<h3>My Contribution</h3>
	<p>
		This was a solo project, so everything visible is made by me, including the underlying system for aspects/values and their weighting, and the city building aspects such as land claiming, building, and the random world generation.

	<h3>Post-Mortem</h3>
		Working on this project ended up being very poignant. When playtesting, I found that industrial buildings were the quickest way to ensure cultural expansion, even though they had numerous negative side effects as well. Just by plugging in the numbers, the simulation demonstrated that industrialization is the fast path to globalization; it is hard to expand as a culture and still preserve what makes your culture unique. Of course, some of the data was arbitrary, so it must all be taken with a grain (or barrel) of salt, but it was still interesting to see these results.
