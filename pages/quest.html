	<h1>Quest</h1>
	<h3>Summary & Technical Overview</h3>
	<p>
		<em>Quest</em> is a small adventure game created as a semester project, paying homage to traditional adventure game series, such as <em>The Legend of Zelda</em>.
	</p>
	<br />
	
	<h3>Technical Overview & My Contribution</h3>
	<p>
		<em>Quest</em> is coded in C#, using the MonoGame framework.
		My main job was the underlying engine. This included creating a world you could walk around
		in (including map handling and the draw loop), player-object-enemy interactions (attacking,
		object pickup, and inventory), progression, and combat elements, such as health and
		enemy AI. Maps are loaded in from CSV-style files where IDs represent different tiles.
	</p>
	<br />
	
	<h3>Mechanics & Design</h3>
	<p>
		The idea was to make a game that was as stereotypical of an adventure game as possible,
		inspired by the like of <em>The Legend of Zelda</em>. This served as the theme and central
		joke of the game - the enemies are slimes, the boss is the Doom Wizard, and even the name,
		just 'Quest'. It allowed us to focus on a solid code base and art as opposed to overscoping the project.
	</p>
	<br />
	
	<p>
		Players start with just the sword, and acquire a bow and an ice staff as the game progresses.
		The player starts with three hearts, which are divided into quarters. Progression requires finding five
		coloured gems. Each gem unblocks the path being guarded by its matching statue (the one of the
		same colour). They also each add a heart to the players max health.
