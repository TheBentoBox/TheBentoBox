	<h1>Quest</h1>
	<h3>Summary & Technical Overview</h3>
	<p>
		<em>Quest</em> is a small adventure game created as a semester project, paying homage to traditional adventure game series, such as <em>The Legend of Zelda</em>. It's developed in C#, using the MonoGame framework as part of the engine; it uses no game engine outside of this. Saving and loading is done through CSV-style files which return the game to its previous state. Object and tile types are stored by ID in a 2D array, and the objects within view of the player are rendered offset based on the player's position, which simulates movement.
	</p>
	<br />
	
	<h3>My Contribution</h3>
	<p>
		My main job was the underlying engine. This included creating a world you could walk around in (including map handling and the draw loop), player-object-enemy interactions (attacking, object pickup, and inventory), progression, and combat elements, such as health, enemy AI, projectiles, and activatable objects.
	</p>
	<br />
	
	<h3>Post-Mortem</h3>
	<p>
		The game is very simple, but it ended up being exactly what it had to be given the project's scope. As a first exercise in coding a game from scratch without a fully-fledged engine, it was a great learning experience in many ways (world drawing, tilesets, and coding 2D gameplay from scratch).
	</p>
	<br />
	<p>
		As this was more of a learning experience than anything else, I have no personal interest in going back to this project to work more on it. It ended up in a state we were happy in, and given we were first years in college, that's enough for me.
