	<h1>Audio Visualizer</h1>
	<h3>Summary & Technical Overview</h3>
	<p>
		The audio visualizer is a web app that streams three songs and visualizes them on-screen. It has different customization options to let you change the colors of the visualizer bars, the background of the visualizer, and various other display properties such as the audio bar smoothness.
	</p>
	<br />
	<p>
		The visualizer uses the HTML5 web audio API to stream the songs' waveform data. A small exponential formula is applied to the values returned from the audio stream to make the movement of the bars more pronounced. Each update tick the overall volume of the stream is stored, and if it experiences a notable volume increase from the previous frame, the visualizer releases a colored pulse (the pulse colors loop through the colors of the current gradient). This makes the visualization appear to pulse with the beat of the music.

	<h3>My Contribution</h3>
	<p>
		This was a solo project, so everything described above was created by me, as well as other random aspects such as the HTML and CSS for the original page's layout (before it was brought to my porfolio). Oh, and I got to choose the songs, too!
	</p>
	<br />

	<h3>What I Learned</h3>
	<p>
		The audio visualizer was my first more extensive experience with JavaScript and canvas, which is greatly appreciated because I came to enjoy them both. The amount of customization I ended up adding to the visualizer gave me early experience connecting DOM elements and canvas mouse interactions with the canvas itself. The visualization uses three canvases apart from the main one, and nine separate page elements that can further manipulate it.
	</p>
	<br />
	<p>
		There's not really much to it, but of course it has the limitation of just playing the three songs I chose. It'd be nice to hook into the YouTube API one day to allow people to input a YouTube video URL to stream from (though the YouTube ToS doesn't allow the separation of audio from a video, so the video would probably need to be shown as the visualizer background).
