	<h3>Description & Project Role</h3>
	<p>
		The audio visualizer is a web app that streams three songs (which I chose) and visualizes them onscreen. It was a solo project, so I did
		all of the programming.
	</p>
	<br />

	<h3>Technical Overview & My Contribution</h3>
	<p>
		The visualizer uses the HTML5 web audio API to stream the songs from file and display their waveform data on screen. I don't feed the data
		directly onto the screen - I applied a small exponential formula to the numbers returned from the audio stream to make the movement of the
		bars more pronounced. The bars are drawn via a linear gradient which is created based on the gradient editor to the right of the canvas. I
		store the overall volume of the stream each frame, and if it increases by at least 10% over the previous frame, the visualizer releases a colored
		pulse; the pulse colors loop through the colors of the current gradient. This makes the visualization appear to pulse with the beat of the music.
	</p>
	<br />

	<h3>What I Learned</h3>
	<p>
		The audio visualizer was my first extensive experience with JavaScript and canvas, which I greatly appreciate because I have come to love
		them both. It was particularly useful because of the amount of customization I added to the visualizer. It gave me a lot of experiencing connecting
		DOM elements and canvas mouse interactions with the canvas itself. The visualization uses three canvases apart from the main one, and nine
		separate page elements that can further manipulate it.
