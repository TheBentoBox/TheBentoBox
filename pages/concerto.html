	<h1>Concerto</h1>
	<h3>Description & Project Role</h3>
	<p>
		<em>Concerto</em> is a web app that lets users search for an artist, simultaneously getting results for upcoming shows by the artists and
		previews of that artist's work from Spotify. It was a solo project, so I did all of the programming.
	</p>
	<br />

	<h3>Technical Overview & My Contribution</h3>
	<p>
		<em>Concerto</em> was created in JavaScript, and additionally uses jQuery, mainly for making AJAX calls to web APIs. It uses the Bandsintown API
		to retrieve the concert listing, and Spotify's API to retrieve the song previews, including the album covers which are clicked to activate the preview.
		The Bandsintown API returns the latitude and longitude of the concert venue, so I found a function that can get the distance between two latitude-longitude
		coordinate pairs, and use it to get the distance between the user and the venues. This is only done if the user decides to sort the concerts by distance from
		them. To get their latitude and longitude coordiantes, the site uses the HTML geolocation API.
	</p>
	<br />

	<h3>What I Learned</h3>
	<p>
		This was my first extensive foray into the use of web APIs. It was interesting to figure out how to communicate between multiple APIs and HTML5 technologies,
		as well as designing an app that created a cohesive experience based on the possibilities made available by the data that the web services decided to return. It
		was a great learning experience, because it taught me how to navigate the large JSON objects returned by these web APIs, and how to manipulate them as I
		need to mould an experience from the data.
