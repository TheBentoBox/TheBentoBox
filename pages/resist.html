	<h1>Resist!</h1>
	<h3>Description & Project Role</h3>
	<p>
		<em>Resist!</em> is a game created as a learning device to aid students in the understanding of electronic circuits
		and their various subcomponents - in this case, resistors. I acted as the sole programmer, and did some of the pixel art as well.
	</p>
	<br />
	
	<h3>Technical Overview & My Contribution</h3>
	<p>
		I created this project in my senior year of high school. It was created in Game Maker using its proprietary programming language, GML. 
		The circuits that must be completed are chosen randomly from a pool of different pre-determined puzzles. The levels are also pre-determined,
		but the biome of each level can vary between playthroughs; map objects query the global biome variable to update their graphics.
	</p>
	<br />
	<p>
		My programming skill has grown immensely since this project, but I leave it here because I believe it displays important
		qualities, such as growth and an early passion. I taught myself GML, so this project occurred during a moment in my life when
		I was learning to program for the first time.
	</p>
	<br />
	
	<h3>Mechanics & Design</h3>
	<p>
		The game takes place inside of a computer. You play as an electron who is trying to escape due to the computer being taken
		over by an evil trojan named Keith. Each level contains a blue door, next to which is a crafting station and a circuit board containing
		an incomplete circuit. The circuit can be completed by crafting the correct resistor at the crafting station. Players also can complete
		circuits to create health packets (batteries) or upgrade their guns or armor.
	</p>
	<br />
	
	<p>
		There are many hazards and interactable objects throughout the levels:
		<ul>
			<li>Catapults - the player can sit it in, adjust it, and then fire it</li>
			<li>Magnets - pull or push the player depending on their polarity</li>
			<li>Capacitors - gates that cross gaps which need electrons to be activated</li>
			<li>Lava pools, button activated gates, virus spawning nodes, springs, etc.</li>
		</ul>
		<br />
		You progress by killing enemy 'viruses'. Resistors use colored bands to indicate how many ohms of resistance
		they have. There is an enemy of each color, each of whom drops the colored band that matches them. Each
		level will randomly be one of four biomes, which only differ aesthetically.
