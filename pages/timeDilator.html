	<h3>Description & Project Role</h3>
	<p>
		<em>Time Dilator</em> is, similar to <em>Resist!</em>, a game created as a learning device to teach
		students about the math behind time dilation. I acted as the sole programmer, and did some of the pixel art as well.
	</p>
	<br />
	
	<h3>Technical Overview & My Contribution</h3>
	<p>
		I created this project in my senior year of high school. It was created in Game Maker using its proprietary programming language, GML. 
		The most difficult part to program is the central aspect of the game: the randomly generated time dilation questions. The questions
		aren't trivial; they are mathematic, and ask the user to calculate the lifetime of a particle based on how fast it is moving relative to
		the speed of life. The particle's lifetime, and how fast it is going, are chosen randomly. The game then solves the problem and creates
		three buttons that display answers, two of which are slightly off versions of the correct one.
	</p>
	<br />
	<p>
		My programming skill has grown immensely since this project, but I leave it here because I believe it displays important
		qualities, such as growth and an early passion. I taught myself GML, so this project occurred during a moment in my life when
		I was learning to program for the first time.
	</p>

	<h3>Mechanics & Design</h3>
	<p>
		In the game, you are meant to be an alien who has discovered the secrets of light speed travel.
		Once you begin using it, however, the Guardians of the Universe (who you can assume to be a race
		that far surpasses your own in power) intervene, saying you don't deserve the kind of power
		granted by light speed travel. This is all just backstory, however - in practice, the game is
		really a psychadelic shooter.
	</p>
	<br />
	 
	<p>
		There are five levels, each one becoming increasingly more difficult. After you defeat the wave
		of ships that come with a level, you are asked five time dilation questions. You gain credits for
		answering correctly, and likewise lose credits for answering incorrectly. After your answer them
		all, you are taken to the shop, where you can buy upgrades. You can either upgrade your speed,
		your hull (armor), or your guns. You can also buy health in packets of 25, which is necessary as 
		health carries over between levels.
	</p>
	<br />
	
	<p>
		The five normal levels are followed by the boss level, which consists of a massive ship you must
		destroy. You must first destroy the four side engines before the main body of the ship becomes
		vulnerable. Destroying the boss ship beats the game, after which you are free to replay any of
		the levels, visit the shop, or submit your score.
