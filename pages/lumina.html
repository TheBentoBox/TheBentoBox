	<h3>Description & Project Role</h3>
	<p>
		<em>Lumina</em> is a 2D sidescroller created in 5 weeks. The player can cast spells to defeat enemies and can capture checkpoints as they
		explore the world. I acted as the lead gameplay programmer and engine developer.
	</p>
	<br />

	<h3>Technical Overview & My Contribution</h3>
	<p>
		<em>Lumina</em> was created in Javascript using canvas. It uses no pre-defined engine - I coded all gameplay behaviors from scratch.
		The most programmatically complicated aspect of the game is the lighting engine, which uses canvas composite operations. The game screen
		is first drawn normally to an offscreen canvas. It is then copied to the onscreen canvas, and is masked with a black overlay. Then, light sources
		are cut out from the destination canvas silhouette. After that, the original colored image is placed below the silhouette, the sky background is
		placed below everything, and then post-process draw calls are made.
	</p>
	<br />
	<p>
		Because of the complexity of the lighting and parallaxes, the game can have performance issues on some browsers. If I were to do the project over, it
		would be in WebGL for optimum performance.
	</p>
	<br />

	<h3>Mechanics & Design</h3>
	<p>
		Almost everything in the game world is porytrayed as a near pitch black silhouette. The player character is a wizard whose spells can damage enemies
		and cast light upon objects, temporarily revealing them. The design of the world relies largely on the ambience created by the colors and lighting.
		Players prepare spells in two parts. The first selection is of the spell type - bolt, rune, or grenade. Bolts are weaker with long range, runes lay down
		a trap on the ground, and grenades are much slower but do an AOE blast of heavy damage.
	<p>
	<br />
	</p>
		Each spell type can also be one of three elements - fire, water, and earth. Due to the short development time of the project, there isn't much difference
		between the elements. Fire spells do additional burn damage over time, earth spells do the most damage but are the heaviest, and water spells do the least
		damage, but are the lightest.
