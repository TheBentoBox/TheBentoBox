	<h3>Description & Project Role</h3>
	<p>
		<em>Psychosis</em> is a board game that was developed as a semester project. The concept and core
		gameplay elements were my design, and I acted as the project lead.
	</p>
	<br />
	
	<h3>My Contribution</h3>
	<p>
		The game was developed in a group of five students (including myself). As the game concept way my idea, I helped
		guide our group meetings to keep the ideas on track with the goals of the game, but we worked as a team to work
		out balancing issues and gameplay quirks. My main personal responsibility was developing the characters, including
		their names, ages, personalities, and their unique abilities. Many of the characters are based on real people, and their
		ages are accurate to the implied time period of the game (early 1920s).
	</p>
	<br />
	
	<h3>Mechanics & Design</h3>
	<p>
		The game is themed as a Lovecraftian horror game, taking place in a strange alternate realm. You play
		as one of ten characters, who were transported to the realm as the result of a cult's summoning ritual gone
		awry. To escape, they need to become sane enough to survive the return trip through the portal. Before the
		portal will open, however, they must defeat a powerful monster known as the Guardian.
	</p>
	<br />
	<p>
		The game centers around sanity, which acts as the health, win condition, lose condition, <em>and</em> currency. 
		You win by having enough sanity to escape the portal, which opens once the Guardian boss is defeated. You buy items
		and cast spells by sacrificing sanity. When your sanity is low enough to be considered insane, you gain the ability to
		move through insanity paths - shortcuts that aren't accessible otherwise. Some characters get additional buffs while 
		insane to help keep them alive.
	</p>
	<br />
	
	<p>
		Interesting dynamics arise due to the focus on sanity. You'll inevitably lose sanity through combat with the Guardian to
		unlock the escape portal, but you need that sanity to use the portal. It's helpful to work together, but PvP is allowed,
		and is likely required if you want to win. This creates a two phase dynamic to the game. At the start, you need other
		players alive to help defeat the Guardian. Immediately afterwards, everyone becomes your worst enemy, and you crawl
		over each other to be the first one to the portal. You'll spend a lot of time trying to keep others at a lower sanity instead
		of actually trying to win yourself, so the winner is usually a player who finds themself at the right place at the right time.
