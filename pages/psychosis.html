	<h1>Psychosis</h1>
	<h3>Summary</h3>
	<p>
		<em>Psychosis</em> is a Lovecrafting horror board game that was developed as a semester project. 
		You play as one of ten characters, who are trapped in an alternate realm. To escape, they need to become sane enough 
		to survive the return trip through the portal, but the 'Guardian' (a boss) must be killed to open the portal.
	</p>
	<br />
	<p>
		Sanity is the central mechanic, acting as the health, win condition, lose condition, <em>and</em> currency. 
		The exit portal requires sanity, which is directly lost through combat damage, purchasing items, and casting spells.
		Some options are only available to sane or insane players, and some characters are more affected by insanity than others.
	</p>
	<br />
	
	<h3>My Contribution</h3>
	<p>
		As it was my concept, I took the role of projet lead, including guiding meetings and keeping discussions on track towards the game's goal. 
		My main personal responsibility was developing the characters: names, ages, personalities, and their unique abilities. Many of the characters 
		are inspired by real people, with their ages being accurate to the implied time period of the game (early 1920s), and their abilities reflecting
		their roles and personalities.
	</p>
	<br />
	
	<h3>Moving Forward</h3>
	<p>
		<em>Psychosis</em> is easily one of the most all-around fun projects I've worked on (both fun to make and to play), namely due to 
		the interesting dynamics created by sanity being the sole resource. It's helpful to work together to beat the Guardian, but PvP is not only allowed, 
		it's almost unavoidable. This creates an unofficial two phase dynamic, where players work together to defeat the Guardian, then immediately turn on 
		each other to be the first one through the portal. It becomes a truly insane feeling scenario, and the winner often just finds themselves at the right 
		place at the right time.
	</p>
	<br />
	<p>
		In the end, I'd love to one day move forward with this project, or something similar since it may be difficult to reassemble the original 
		development group. It's really only missing assets, which are unfortunately a big hurdle between here and production (and not something
		I'm confident enough to develop at production-level myself).
